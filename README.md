# Minimal++ Compiler

## About
This project, written in Python, was developed for the purposes of the Compilers course at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina](https://www.cse.uoi.gr/) 

## Description
Minimal++ is a small programming language built for the Compilers courses needs. Although this educational language has limited capabilities, the development of its compiler holds a lot of potential and promises to be highly interesting, containing many feautures of other high level languages and some original. Minimal++ supports, function and procedures, parameter transmision by reference and by value, recursive calls and more interesting structures, such as nesting in function decleration. On the other hand, minimal++ does not support traditional structures, such as for loops or data types, such as real number and strings. The purpose of these omissions is to simplify compilers development process and overall lines of code, and not to make the project easy or diminish the educational value of it.
